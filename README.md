# 6D Object Instance Recognition from RGB

In this work we analyse the Object Perception Problem from a physical point of view, we provide a formal definition and derive an important theorem. This analysis is realised from a differential topology view. Afterwards we solve the problem by using the method: [RGB Gradient Based Polar-Fourier Descriptor for Texture-less 6-D Object Instance Recognition](https://github.com/davreixach/RGBpfDescriptor).
